# Moving Boxes

An assignment for MOB 1.1 to help students practice SWIFT and OOP knowledge by making games with SpriteKit.

In this project, I made a simple game where there are squares moving up at varying speeds. The objective of this game is to tap the moving boxes before they reach to the top of the screen in order to earn point. The player loses when their score reaches -1.
